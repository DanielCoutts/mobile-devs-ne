# Mobile Devs NE

## About This Community
The Mobile Devs NE community has been set up in order to provide Android and iOS developers with somewhere to share ideas, ask questions, and collaborate. 

The main reason for the creation of this community is to facilitate the kind of interactions that would typically be had between members of a development team. When working at smaller organisations, or as a freelance developer, you may be the only developer within your discipline, giving you less immediate access to others who you can “bounce ideas off“. The goal of this community is to offer a place where we can do just that! (Disclaimer: Of course there are some things that can be shared internally with colleagues that should not be shared here.)

## Code of Conduct
It is important that we have a code of conduct in place to ensure that this is a safe, inclusive, and welcoming place. This is outlined below:

### Moderators
The community moderators are:
* Daniel Coutts
* Eimear Flynn
* Matt Hallatt

You can reach us over DM if you have any questions or would like to raise an issue.

We will:
* Respond as promptly as possible to reports of violations.
* Make an effort to understand both sides in the case of any conflict.
* Keep each other accountable.
* Not interfere with the handling an incident if we have been identified as a possible Code of Conduct violator.

### Behaviour
The below behaviour is expected of all members of this community:
* Being respectful to others in all of your contributions.
* Maintaining the same level of professionalism in your interactions as you would be expected to in any other professional situation.
* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Refraining for the usage of demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour or speech.
* Being mindful of your surroundings and fellow participants.
* Ensuring that contributions you make to the community are meaningful and relevant.
* Alerting moderators if you notice anything of concern, including situations where you are concerned for someone’s wellbeing, or the code of conduct is being violated.
* Keep an open mind, don’t shoot people’s ideas down when presenting your own, and try to learn from others.
* Don’t offer unsolicited criticism of others’ work, however well-meaning. If someone has started an open discussion, it is great to offer your own perspective. However, if someone shares their own work with the community, refrain from offering criticism unless feedback has been explicitly requested.
* When asking for feedback, be prepared to accept well-communicated constructive criticism.
* When offering feedback, try to include at least some positive points.

Harassment includes:
* Discriminatory language and actions that reinforce existing social imbalances relating to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, religion (or lack thereof), or other identity markers.
* Excessive trolling or sustained, uninvited disruption.
* Insults or personal attacks.
* Violent or personally objectifying material.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions like “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Violent language or threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming unprofessional levels of intimacy with others.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent.
* Threatening to post or posting other people’s personally identifiable information without consent.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication without consent.
* Blogging, tweeting, or otherwise communicating with intent to harm someone’s reputation, i.e., “making an example” of a community participant.
* Intimidation, stalking, or following.
* Harassing or unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

### Procedures
If you wish to report any violation of the code of conduct, suggest any improvements to the code of conduct, or raise any other matters, please DM one of the moderators listed at the top of this document. Any reports of code of conduct violations will be confidential, and will only be discussed by moderators that are not involved in the incident.

If we believe a member of the community has violated the code of conduct, the matter will be raised with them privately before any further action is taken.

Should a member be deemed to have purposefully, persistently, or unapologetically violated the Code of Conduct, the moderators reserve the right to take any action they deem appropriate, including permanent removal from the community.
